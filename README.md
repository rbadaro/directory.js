Simple homepage I use to keep all my links organized. 

As I type, links get filtered. I can then tab through them or if there is only one, press enter.

I also have some prefix actions, for instance, if I write "g search term", it will go to google and search search term. I use this for things like Jira tickets where it recognizes the prefix of the tickets and navigates quickly.

Code is a bit shit. Links are added to the sections array and actions to the list array in directory.js.
